# Photoset Grid

A simple jQuery plugin to arrange images into a flexible grid, based on Tumblr's photoset feature. Originally the plugin was created for our [Style Hatch](http://stylehatch.co) Tumblr themes as a way to use the photoset grid in responsive layouts, but we have since expanded it for use outside of the themes.

## Notice

This is just some modifications to fit my personal needs, and since I'm no javascript expert, you'll be better off using the original one by *stylehatch*
